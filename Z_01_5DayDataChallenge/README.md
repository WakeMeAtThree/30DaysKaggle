# [The 5-Day Data Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/the-5-day-data-challenge)

Rachael Tatman from Kaggle has been organizing 5-day data challenges from time to time, and they usually revolve around a particular theme in data. This first 5-day challenge is a bit introductory and meant to showcase workflow in python (and R) for performing certain data-oriented tasks. This notebook will follow along with the notebooks she posted, and I'm intending to vary it a bit to include other datasets and answer particular questions there. I'm also interested in brushing up on topics such as ttests and chi-squared tests. 

## Challenges

I won't upload the datasets in this repo, but you can find the them in the links below.

I thought it would be best to include a visual documentation of useful functions gained from this challenge for reference. I've highlighted certain things I would like to revisit in the future.
