# 30 Days of Kaggle

This is a WIP repo meant to structure a way of finishing kaggle competition entries. I'm planning to start by going through the `Getting Started` set of competitions, and as is the case with the other repos, it's meant to gather a momentum to continue with after the end of this repository as well as gather a set of tools to be used in future projects.
